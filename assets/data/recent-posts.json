          "link": "http://orchardproject.net:80/Contents/Item/Display/35791",
          "description": "<p>Microsoft are running a free program called <a href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-dev-essentials-vs\">Visual Studio Dev Essentials</a>. It has a range of useful and not so useful 'developer benefits' included in it.</p>
<p>Two that I've found valuable are the 3 month free Pluralsight subscription and the free monthly Azure credits. There are a broad range of other resources included though and from the ones I've tried they are totally free-to-try, not \"add your credit card and remember to cancel it before we charge you\".</p>
<p>The free 3 month Pluralsight subscription gives you access to a ton of topics, but there are also two Orchard-specific video courses:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=\"https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/orchard-fundamentals\">Orchard Fundamentals</a></li>
<li><a href=\"https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/adv-orchard\">Advanced Orchard</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The courses target Orchard v1.4 but almost everything is still applicable today (for example Contrib.Taxonomies is now a core module, ContentParts can now take advantage of infoset and some minor admin panel UI differences) but it is a great introduction to learning Orchard.</p>
<p>The Azure Developer Benefit includes $25 a month to spend on Azure for one year. If you want to spend more than that you can uncap the subscription and use it as a discounted starter package to get up and running with your website for the first year.</p>",

In this post, we will take Orchard tokens functonality to another level of dynamicity, by implementing new token called \"Dictionary\", to be able to support any type of objects, with dynamic chain building.</p>",

          "description": "<p>We have been gradually moving things to Azure over the last year, including some of Orchard installations. Orchard plays nice with Azure and setting up Azure services like blob storage to complement your Azure deployment are surprisingly simple. You can use blob settings to store media, but also to store your App_Data configuration. To store Orchard's appdata in blob storage you need to make some changes to the Host.config file, however since the solution I work from is also used to deploy to sites that use s3 and just the file system to store&nbsp;App_Data&nbsp;, I thought I could make a little transform to handle this.</p>",
